# ChatGPT Flutter App

This is a simple Flutter app that demonstrates how to integrate OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model with a chat UI using the flutter_chat_ui and flutter_chat_types libraries. The app allows users to send messages to a chatbot powered by GPT-3.5 and receive responses in real time.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- Flutter SDK installed on your machine.
- An OpenAI API key with access to the GPT-3.5 model.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory and run `flutter pub get` to install the necessary dependencies.

Replace the openAiAPIKey constant in the main.dart file with your OpenAI API key, or run the project with the `dart-define` CLI option.

Connect your device or start an emulator and run flutter run to start the app.
